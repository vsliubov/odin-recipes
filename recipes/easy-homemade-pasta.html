        <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b>This homemade pasta recipe starts with two cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b>Eggs lend fat and moisture to the pasta dough. </li>
        <li><b>Oil:</b>Two tablespoons of olive oil add moisture and help the dough come together.</li>
        <li><b>Salt:</b>A teaspoon of salt takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
